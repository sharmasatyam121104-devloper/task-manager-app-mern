# Task Manager App

A full stack **MERN** application for managing daily tasks with authentication and CRUD operations.
This is my **first full stack project**, built completely from scratch without following any tutorials.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The Task Manager App allows users to register, log in, and manage their tasks efficiently.
It includes full CRUD functionality and secure JWT-based authentication.
The frontend uses **React** with **Redux Toolkit** and **Async Thunk** for state management and API calls.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React, Redux Toolkit, Axios
**Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
**Database:** MongoDB

## 🔑 Features

* User authentication (JWT-based)
* Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks
* Protected routes for authorized users
* State management using Redux Toolkit
* Async API calls handled with Async Thunk and Axios
* Responsive and clean user interface

---

## 📘 Learning Highlights

* Built without relying on YouTube or external templates
* Learned how frontend and backend connect through APIs
* Implemented Redux Toolkit and Async Thunk from scratch
* Gained confidence in handling authentication and state management in full stack apps
